    "- An **array** is a collection of homogeneous data-types that are stored in contiguous memory locations. \n",
    "- On the other hand, a **list** in Python is a collection of heterogeneous data types stored in non-contiguous memory locations.\n",
    "- The flexibility of lists comes at a cost: to allow these flexible (dynamic) types, each item is a complete Python object and contains its own type info, reference count, and other information. \n",
    "- In numpy arrays, the variables are of the same (fixed) type, so a lot of this information is redundant.\n",

    "- For the the array, we have a single pointer to one contiguous block of data. \n",
    "- The Python list is a pointer to a block of pointers. Each of these pointers points to a Python object. All the extra information needs to be stored.\n",
    "- Fixed-type NumPy-style arrays lack this flexibility, but are much more efficient for storing and manipulating data."
