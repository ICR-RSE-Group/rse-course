# rsd-engineeringcourse

Course materials for Turing's Research Software Engineering course. Also see [UCL's](https://github.com/UCL/rsd-engineeringcourse) version of this course.

## Content
In this course, you will move beyond programming, to learn how to construct reliable, readable, efficient research software in a collaborative environment.
The emphasis is on practical techniques, tips, and technologies to effectively build and maintain complex code.
This is a relatively short course (8-10 half-day modules) which is intensive and relatively practical.
Examples and exercises for this course will be provided in `Python`.

## Prerequisites
It would be helpful to have experience in one compiled language, such as `C++`, `C`, or `Fortran`, and one dynamic language, such as `Python`, `Ruby`, `Matlab` or `R`, but this is not a requirement.
Previous experience with version control and/or the Unix shell, for instance from Software Carpentry, would be helpful.
You should bring your own laptop to the course as there are several hands-on exercise for you to work through.
