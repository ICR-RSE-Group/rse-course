# Research Software Engineering with Python

## Introduction

In this course, you will move beyond programming, to learn how to construct reliable, readable, efficient research software in a collaborative environment.
The emphasis is on practical techniques, tips, and technologies to effectively build and maintain complex code.
This is a intensive, practical course.

## Pre-requisites

* Prior knowledge of at least one programming language, including variables, control flow, and functions.
* You are required to bring your own laptop to the course as the classrooms we are using do not have desktop computers.
* We have provided [setup](session99/index.md) instructions for installing the software needed for the course on your computer.
* **Eligibility:** This course is primarily aimed at Turing-connected PhD students. Other Turing-affiliated people might join too if capacity allows.

## Instructors

* [Turing Research Engineering Group](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-engineering)

## Exercises

Examples and exercises for this course will be provided in Python. Python will be introduced during this course, but we will assume you can already program.
That means that you may find supplementary Python content useful.

## Evaluation

**None:** you are not graded. There are two exercises that you can use for self-assessment.

## Versions

You can browse through course notes as HTML or download them as a printable PDF via the navigation bar to the left.

**If you encounter any problem or bug in these materials**, please remember to add an issue to the [course repo](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/rsd-engineeringcourse), explaining the problem and, potentially, its solution.
By doing this, you will improve the instructions for future users. ðŸŽ‰
